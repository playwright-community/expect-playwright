⚠️ We recommend the official Playwright test runner ⚠️

The Playwright test runner includes all the matchers in this repo plus many more to make testing your projects easy. This doesn't mean, that we stop with maintaining this package.

---

This library provides utility matchers for Jest in combination with [Playwright]. All of them are exposed on the `expect` object. You can use them either directly or invert them via the `.not` property like shown in a example below.

```txt
npm install -D expect-playwright
```

## Usage

### With [Playwright test runner](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro)

To activate with the Playwright test runner, use `expect.extend()` in the config to add the `expect-playwright` matchers.

```js
// playwright.config.ts
import { expect } from "@playwright/test"
import { matchers } from "expect-playwright"

expect.extend(matchers)

// ...
```

### With Jest

To activate it in your Jest environment you have to include it in your configuration.

```json
{
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["expect-playwright"]
}
```

## Why do I need it

The [Playwright] API is great, but it is low level and not designed for integration testing. So this package tries to provide a bunch of utility functions to perform the common checks easier.

Example which should wait and compare the text content of a paragraph on the page.

```javascript
// before
await page.waitForSelector("#foo")
const textContent = await page.$eval("#foo", (el) => el.textContent)
expect(textContent).stringContaining("my text")

// after by using expect-playwright
await expect(page).toMatchText("#foo", "my text")
```

But that's not all! Our matchers also work inside of iframes and accept an [ElementHandle] which targets an `iframe` element or a [Frame] obtained by calling `element.contentFrame()`. Not only that, but if you pass a promise, we will automatically resolve it for you!

```javascript
// before
const element = await page.$("iframe")
const frame = await element.contentFrame()
await expect(frame).toBeChecked("#foo")

// after
await expect(page.$("iframe")).toBeChecked("#foo")
```

### toBeChecked

This function checks if a given element is checked.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```javascript
await expect(page).toBeChecked("#my-element")
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#my-element")
await expect(element).toBeChecked()
```

### toBeDisabled

This function checks if a given element is disabled.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```javascript
await expect(page).toBeDisabled("#my-element")
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#my-element")
await expect(element).toBeDisabled()
```

### toBeEnabled

This function checks if a given element is enabled.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```javascript
await expect(page).toBeEnabled("#my-element")
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#my-element")
await expect(element).toBeEnabled()
```

### toHaveFocus

This function checks if a given element is focused.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```js
await expect(page).toHaveFocus("#foobar")
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#foobar")
await expect(element).toHaveFocus()
```

### toHaveSelector

This function waits as a maximum as the timeout exceeds for a given selector once it appears on the page.

```js
await expect(page).toHaveSelector("#foobar")
```

When used with `not`, `toHaveSelector` will wait until the element is not visible or not attached. See the Playwright [waitForSelector](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-wait-for-selector) docs for more details.

```js
await expect(page).not.toHaveSelector("#foobar")
```

### toHaveSelectorCount

This function checks if the count of a given selector is the same as the provided value.

```javascript
await expect(page).toHaveSelectorCount(".my-element", 3)
```

### toMatchAttribute

This function checks if an element's attribute matches the provided string or regex pattern.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchAttribute("#foo", "href", "https://playwright.dev")
await expect(page).toMatchAttribute("#foo", "href", /playwright/)
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#foo")
await expect(element).toMatchAttribute("href", "https://playwright.dev")
await expect(element).toMatchAttribute("href", /playwright/)
```

### toMatchComputedStyle

This function checks if an element's computed style property matches the provided string or regex pattern.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchComputedStyle("#my-element", "color", "rgb(0, 0, 0)")
await expect(page).toMatchComputedStyle("#my-element", "color", /rgb/)
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#my-element")
await expect(element).toMatchComputedStyle("color", "rgb(0, 0, 0)")
await expect(element).toMatchComputedStyle("color", /rgb/)
```

### toMatchText

This function checks if the `textContent` of a given element matches the provided string or regex pattern.

You can do this via a selector on the whole page:

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchText("#my-element", "Playwright")
await expect(page).toMatchText("#my-element", /Play.+/)
```

Or without a selector which will use the `body` element:

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchText("Playwright")
await expect(page).toMatchText(/Play.+/)
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#my-element")
await expect(element).toMatchText("Playwright")
await expect(element).toMatchText(/Play.+/)
```

### toMatchTitle

This function checks if the page or frame title matches the provided string or regex pattern.

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchTitle("My app - page 1")
await expect(page).toMatchTitle(/My app - page \d/)
```

### toMatchURL

This function checks if the current page's URL matches the provided string or regex pattern.

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchURL("https://github.com")
await expect(page).toMatchURL(/github\.com/)
```

### toMatchValue

This function checks if the `value` of a given element is the same as the provided string or regex pattern.

You can do this via a selector or the element directly:

```javascript
await expect(page).toMatchValue("#my-element", "Playwright")
await expect(page).toMatchValue("#my-element", /Play.+/)
```

Or by passing a Playwright [ElementHandle]:

```javascript
const element = await page.$("#my-element")
await expect(element).toMatchValue("Playwright")
await expect(element).toMatchValue(/Play.+/)
```

## Examples

```typescript
import playwright from "playwright-chromium"

describe("GitHub Playwright project", () => {
  it("should should have Playwright in the README heading", async () => {
    const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
    const page = await browser.newPage()
    await page.goto("https://github.com/microsoft/playwright")
    await expect(page).toMatchText("#readme h1", "Playwright")
    // or also all of them via the not property
    await expect(page).not.toMatchText("this-is-no-anywhere", {
      timeout: 1 * 1000,
    })
    await browser.close()
  })
})
```

## TypeScript

There are typings available. For that just import

```typescript
import "expect-playwright"
```

at the top of your test file or include it globally in your `tsconfig.json`.
